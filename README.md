## Description

A personal portfolio, built using JQuery, Bulma, and JavaScript, to showecase my code projects. Many of the projects were completed individually. Group projects include the Fantasy Football Team Building app and the Horse Manager app. All projects use JavaScript as the main language, which allowed for my continued development in ES6.
